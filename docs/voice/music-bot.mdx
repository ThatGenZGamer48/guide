# What are Music Bots?

Music bots allow Discord users to listen to music and play their favourite songs in voice channels. They are often complicated but this guide is devoted to creating a simple music bot using Pycord.

The Pycord repository also contains an [example](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/blob/master/examples/basic_voice.py) for this purpose, which you can view by clicking the link.

## Setting up YoutubeDL

You need a special library known as [youtube_dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) which helps to play audio from sources such as YouTube.

```py title="Setting up YoutubeDL"
import youtube_dl
import asyncio
import discord

bot = discord.Bot(debug_guilds=[...])

# Suppress noise about console usage from errors
youtube_dl.utils.bug_reports_message = lambda: ""

# Set up YoutubeDL format options.
ytdl_format_options = {
    "format": "bestaudio/best",
    "outtmpl": "%(extractor)s-%(id)s-%(title)s.%(ext)s",
    "restrictfilenames": True,
    "noplaylist": True,
    "nocheckcertificate": True,
    "ignoreerrors": False,
    "logtostderr": False,
    "quiet": True,
    "no_warnings": True,
    "default_search": "auto",
    "source_address": "0.0.0.0",  # Bind to ipv4 since ipv6 addresses cause issues at certain times
}

# Configure FFMpeg Options
ffmpeg_options = {"options": "-vn"}

# Set YouTubeDL options.
ytdl = youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ytdl_format_options)
```

Let's now go through this code step by step.
First, we import `youtube_dl`, `asyncio` and the Pycord modules. Then we initialize a new bot by using [`discord.Bot`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html?highlight=discord%20bot#discord.Bot).
Then we turn off `youtube_dl.utils.bug_reports_message` so that we do not recieve messages relating to bug reports.
We need to create a dictionary containing the options required for YoutubeDL to work correctly. You can change these options if you wish.

:::danger

Try not to change the options for YoutubeDL as it may break functionalities or cause issues.
